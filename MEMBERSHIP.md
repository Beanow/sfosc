# Membership in the SFOSC

Welcome! Anyone who is interested in contributing to the SFOSC in any way is welcome
to become a member.

Membership is **not a requirement** for participating in the community.
Members may be consulted about governance of the community. For example through votes.
The [CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES](https://github.com/sfosc/sfosc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
explains several ways you can contribute regardless of membership.

Membership in the community is broad based, available to anyone who is
participating in any fashion. Requirements for membership involve a minimal
amount of verification of identity, and proof of engagement with the community.
Membership consists solely of individuals - there are no corporate community
members.

At the moment, the only privilege membership brings is being able
to vote for the project leader. And, of course, the glory of having your name appended
to this file.

To apply for membership, send a pull request to this file, adding your name and
GitHub ID.
