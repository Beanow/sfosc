# Membership in the SFOSC

Welcome! Anyone who is interested in contributing to the SFOSC in any way is welcome
to become a member. At the moment, the only privilege membership brings is being able
to vote for the project leader. And, of course, the glory of having your name appended
to this file.

## Applying

To apply for membership, send a pull request to this file, adding your name and
GitHub username.

Please mention why you became interested in SFOSC and share some related work.
This is optional though, please share only as much as you would like to.

Existing members will review your application.
The aspects we look for currently are:
- Full name and GitHub username, to serve as minimal verification of identity.
- You have either engaged with SFOSC directly, or have related experience we can verify.
  If this experience is not easily found from your GitHub profile, please mention it
  as part of the pull request.

Interested, but not sure if you meet the requirements?
Go ahead and submit your pull request! We're glad you're interested and there to help.
