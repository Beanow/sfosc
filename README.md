Welcome to the SFOSC! This is the place to contribute content to the website,
and collaborate on writing new social contracts, documenting business models,
and more.

[You might rather see the site in its final, rendered form](https://sfosc.org) - it's easier to read that way. 

To contribute, send a pull request. By doing so, you agree to have your content
distributed and shared under the same terms as the LICENSE.md file dictates.

You should read our [Social Contract](https://github.com/sfosc/sfosc/blob/master/SOCIAL_CONTRACT.md) - it contains everything you need to know about how the community works.

If you want to join the project as a voting member (which pretty much just
means you get to vote for the project leader), add yourself to the [membership file](https://github.com/sfosc/sfosc/blob/master/MEMBERSHIP.md).

If you want to propose changes, or new directions for the project, start or join
a thread in an issue.
