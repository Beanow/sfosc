## About workgroups

Workgroups are responsible for particular tasks within our community.
By letting them be autonomous and responsible for their respective tasks there are two main benefits:

- Authority can be more decentralized.
- Contributors can more easily help with the particular tasks they're interested in.

**Joining/leaving a workgroup**

`TODO: this depends on technical implementation of the workgroups.`

Workgroups are open to anyone. If you're interested, you can join them without any approval
process. Likewise you can leave whenever you like.

**Roles within a workgroup**

Within a workgroup there can be different roles. Each workgroup can define these for themselves.
However there are two roles common to all workgroups.

- Leader - 1 or more people who currently have authority within the workgroup.
- Joined - Anyone who joins a workgroup has the joined role by default.

**Proposing new workgroups**

The Governance and Guidance workgroup reviews proposals for new workgroups.
There is no formalized process for this, so feel free to create an issue or reach out to one of the
workgroup members.

## Workgroup listing
