The free and open source community is in a state of introspection deeper than at any time in its history. We are having conversations around "sustainable business models", the rise of "as a service" behemoths in AWS, Google and Microsoft. Questions about if ethics has a place in our governance and licensing models. We are questioning the basic values and ideas of the movement itself.

Since the term Open Source was first adopted in 1997, it has become the dominant software development model around the world. Back then, it was a cutting edge idea - participating in open source was a radical act. It required some philosophical background to even participate in it. Today, you can be an active participant in Open Source with no background at all in the philosophy. Open Source is in the water for a generation of software developers.

At the same time, the number of open source companies has skyrocketed. Consulting companies, service providers, managed services, and venture backed startups abound. This influx of capital into the production of open source software fuels our growth. Open Source is eating the world not only because the Bazaar is better for development. It is good business.

This commerce often happens as direct product revenue (selling open source products to customers). It happens indirectly more frequently, when the software is a component enabling the business (using open source to generate revenue). This massive influx of capital, on both sides of the equation, raises interesting questions. Can there even be software at this scale without businesses funding it? Are we comfortable with how it is used? Where does the community begin and end? Who can take part in the community, how, and why? Who can profit from the software, and how?

35 years have passed since Richard Stallman introduced us to the idea of Free Software. 20 years since the dawn of the Open Source era at Netscape. Why are we building open source software in the first place? What is it good for? Who does it serve? How do we ensure that, no matter what happens, or who participates in our community, that the work we do serves us all? It is time to reassess our fundamental principles.

This is my attempt to start that conversation in earnest. I believe the path forward requires a restatement of our fundamental principles and goals. It leads to a new, intentional, sustainable model for designing our Open Source communities. It embraces the existence of capital in the system. It reconciles the existence of open source projects with open source products. It is inclusive of everyone who wants to participate.

The result is the creation of the Sustainable Free and Open Source Community project. There are three parts. The first is the Principles - a list of requirements for a sustainable free and open source community. The second is a set of Community Social Contracts, the number of which should grow over time. These are explicit social contracts that all participants can agree to and understand. Think of it like Creative Commons, but for the social contract a community agrees to. This document is the last piece - it is the explanation of how I arrived at the beginning of this journey. My hope is that it provides a baseline of knowledge for future collaboration, in the open, as a community. Together, we will evolve the principles, publish many social contracts, and can talk about the trade-offs we make in choosing one contract over the other. 

We'll begin with a restatement of my own background and motivations. I want my own bias to be as clear as possible, so they can be challenged as we build on these ideas together. The rest is the explanation of the model and analysis I used to arrive at the Principles. I look forward to refining them with you, and developing clear social contracts based on them. I'm excited to explore how we can build sustainable communities together.
