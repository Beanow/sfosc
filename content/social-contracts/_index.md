# Social Contracts

This section will contain ready to use social contracts, that can easily be adopted by
open source communities. It is a work in progress - in particular, there is only a
draft of a single contract so far.

In the future, we hope to have many contracts, some of which are sustainable, and
some of which are not, and have easy to fill out generators for projects. For now,
though - take a look at where we are heading, and get involved if you have ideas.
